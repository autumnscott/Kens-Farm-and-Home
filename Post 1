## In the beginning
Ken and Marilyn closed their gas station, "Ken's MFA" in Mansfield, Missouri in the beginning of 1976 before moving to Miami, Oklahoma. Ken's tire supplier, Raye Moore introduced Ken to Ray Swisher and Loui Feldman in 1976 who, after meeting, decided to open a farm store and began searching for locations. The men reviewed several locations including West Plains, Missouri and Paragould, Arkansas. After reviewing the demographics of several areas, the men decided Miami, Oklahoma. (??????). Ken closed his gas station in 1976 and stayed during the week in the "Thunderbird" motel leaving his wife, Marilyn, and two teenage daughters, Kathleen and Novaleen, in Mansfield. Ken travelled back to Mansfield every weekend to be with his family, while spending the week constructing the building for his future farm store. 
 
The men contracted with Collins Construction to build the 30,000???? square feet metal building.The building was located on 2220 E Steve Owens Boulevard on a ???? acre land right next to the Turnpike Gate. The land the store was built on was originally a wheat field outside of city limits. After ??? months of construction, the battle began. Ken and partners began the search of electricians to wire the store. After searching, every company the men asked to wire the building said no due to threats from the electric company in town. The company, Booth and Booth Electric threatened other electricians by saying "they were going to take away their license" if they wired the building. The family of Ken and Marilyn believe this to be because Booth and Booth Electric did not want the farm and home store in town due to competetive fear. Ken and partners contracted electrician ????Cooley???? from Stillwater, Oklahoma. After Cooley wired the building, the business operated off of a temporary pole whilst waiting for the city inspector to improve the electric work done by Cooley. Shortly after the business opened in November of 1977, the City of Miami came and removed the pole the store had been generating electricity from because they did not approve the inspection. Local farmers, Leo Glenn, Ray Schumake, and several others got together and brought Ken a generator to help provide electricity. The men said they would do whatever it took to help keep Ken's Farm and Home in business and to keep the business in town. When the city pulled the electric pole during business hours, customers were left stranded in the dark. Employees gathered flash lights to help guide customers throughout the store and to help cashiers see to write paper tickets. The business ran off a generator for ??? time. Every morning, Ken would go start up the old John Deere tractor and the generator to help keep his new business  afloat. No matter what Ken, his business partners, or his family faced, they were going to fight. After ??? time the business ran off the generator, the city engineer came in and said "he had to find at least one thing wrong". After finding his one thing, he told Ken to fix the problem. So Ken did. After Ken fixed the problem, the city finally gave the business electricity. Ken filed a lawsuit against the city ???? (get more information). 
After ???? years, the city limits stretched out just to the outskirts of the land Ken's Farm and Home sat upon. Therefore giving the city revenue due to city taxes forced upon the business. Before the city limits were stretched, customers only had to pay state tax.
